# travel-site
Create a Travel Site  Create a one page app that allows users to search for hotels. The search options should be: City Check In Date Check Out Date Star Rating (optional) Amenities (optional) Price (optional)  Force the user to enter information for the required fields. Once the user hits “Search,” show the results (like Kayak.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, etc). When the user clicks “more information” on a particular listing, open a Modal with the listing’s details. In the modal, give them the ability to “hide the listing” from the search results. Use a Carousel on the initial Search Page with different cities that our wary travelers can visit. Use a mask or datepicker plugin to select dates.  This is a PAIRED PROGRAMMING project so you must work with your partner. Both of you are expected to create issues, review each other’s pull requests, and contribute equally.
